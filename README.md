### 🛠 Structure
The project is broken down into the following projects:  
**Core**
- 🎀 `Abyss` (library) The core of Abyss. This project contains the message receiver, bot host, argument parsers, checks, contexts, results, and the command set.

**Hosts**  
- 🪐 `Abyss.Hosts.Default` (app) This is the default Abyss host, which wraps `Abyss` and runs the bot.
